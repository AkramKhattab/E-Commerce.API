## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkramKhattab/Ecommerce.Store.git
cd Ecommerce.Store
```

2. Set Up the Database
You need to create two PostgreSQL databases:

Ecommerce.Store.App (for storing product and order data).
Ecommerce.Store.Identity (for storing user data).
You can set up PostgreSQL locally or use a cloud-hosted solution like Azure PostgreSQL.

3. Update the Connection Strings
In your appsettings.json, update the connection strings to point to your PostgreSQL databases:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=Ecommerce.Store.App;Username=your-username;Password=your-password",
    "IdentityConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=Ecommerce.Store.Identity;Username=your-username;Password=your-password"
  }
}
```

4. Apply Migrations
Run the following commands to apply the database migrations and set up the tables:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --context EcommerceDbContext
dotnet ef database update --context StoreIdentityDbContext
```

5. Run the Project
Once the setup is complete, run the project using:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will start and will be accessible at:

http://localhost:5000 (non-secure)

https://localhost:5001 (secure)

Swagger UI will be available at:
```bash
http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

## API Endpoints
Here are some of the key API endpoints:

POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.

POST /api/auth/login: Log in and get a JWT token.

GET /api/products: Get a list of all products.

GET /api/products/{id}: Get details of a single product.

POST /api/products: Add a new product (Admin only).

PUT /api/products/{id}: Update a product (Admin only).

DELETE /api/products/{id}: Delete a product (Admin only).

POST /api/orders: Create a new order.

GET /api/orders: Get all orders (Admin only).

---

## Authentication
This API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Register: Send a POST request to /api/auth/register with user details (e.g., username, email, password).

Login: Send a POST request to /api/auth/login with your username and password to receive a JWT token.

Access Protected Endpoints: To access protected routes like creating products or viewing orders, you need to pass the JWT token in the request header:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
```


---
## Stripe Integration
Stripe is used for payment processing. To use it:

Sign up for Stripe: Create a Stripe account.
Get your API keys: From the Stripe dashboard, obtain your Publishable Key and Secret Key.
Configure Stripe: Update your appsettings.json with your Stripe keys:

```json
{
  "Stripe": {
    "Publishablekey": "your-publishable-key",
    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key"
  }
}
```
